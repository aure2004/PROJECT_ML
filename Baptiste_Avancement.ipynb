    "The transition to electric mobility is emerging as a major challenge for the 21st century, both in terms of the environment and energy. Range is now one of the most decisive criteria for consumers and car manufacturers. It depends on many factors such as battery capacity, engine power, vehicle weight, and aerodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are using the \"Electric Vehicle Specifications 2025\" dataset. This dataset includes detailed technical and descriptive characteristics of electric vehicles sold worldwide, focusing on the latest specifications available in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this study is to model and predict the range of an electric vehicle based on its technical characteristics. Before proceeding to the modeling phase, an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted to understand the structure of the dataset, detect relevant correlations, and prepare the data for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work will ultimately enable us to identify the engineering variables that have the greatest impact on range and efficiency, and build a reliable predictive model for estimating the energy performance of electric vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project contains a total of 478 rows, each corresponding to a unique electric vehicle configuration. It has 22 columns describing the technical, dimensional, and performance characteristics of the vehicles. Unlike datasets focused on usage history, this dataset focuses on factory specifications and design parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main information available includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle Identification: Through the variables brand and model, which specify the manufacturer and the specific model name. A source_url is also provided for verifying specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical Dimensions and Utility: Detailed measurements including length_mm, width_mm, and height_mm help characterize the vehicle's size and potential aerodynamics. Practicality is covered by seats, cargo_volume_l, towing_capacity_kg, segment (e.g., SUV, Compact), and car_body_type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Battery and Charging Technology: This section is critical for our study. It includes battery_capacity_kWh and specific technological details such as battery_type (e.g., Lithium-ion) and number_of_cells. Charging capabilities are detailed by fast_charging_power_kw_dc and the fast_charge_port standard used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy and Dynamic Performance: These variables directly reflect the vehicle's capabilities. They include range_km (the target variable), efficiency_wh_per_km (energy consumption), top_speed_kmh, acceleration_0_100_s, and torque_nm. The drivetrain variable (e.g., AWD, RWD, FWD) provides further context on how power is delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these specifications, we can assess how design choices—such as vehicle size, battery chemistry, and drivetrain configuration—influence the overall range and efficiency of modern electric vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our knowledge, we can identify several relevant criteria that influence the range of electric vehicles before conducting any analysis. In general, the latest models tend to have a longer range, as technological advances enable better energy management and optimized performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the type of vehicle also plays an important role: an SUV generally has a less favorable aerodynamic coefficient than a sedan, which translates into higher fuel consumption and therefore reduced range.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a technical standpoint, a higher-capacity battery logically leads to greater range. However, this relationship also depends on the overall efficiency of the vehicle, i.e., its ability to consume available energy efficiently."
