# ELECTRIC VEHICLE RANGE PREDICTION

This project aims to predict the driving range (range_km) of new Electric Vehicles (EVs) using their technical specifications and design characteristics (battery, dimensions, performance).

The goal is to model the relationship between EV design choices and their energy performance, providing a basis for evaluating and optimizing future vehicle designs.
